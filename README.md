  Description: 
  
    This program simulates the infamous "Monty Hall" game theory problem solved by vos Savant, as described below:
       
    1. Players are shown three (3) doors, two (2) of which hide a goat behind them, and one (1) which hides a car
    2. Players choose a door. After their choice has been made, the game's host opens another door, revealing a 
       goat behind it, and then offers the player a choice: open the door they've already chosen, or switch to the 
       other unopened door.
    3. Statistically, the player has a 2/3 chance of winning a car if they choose to switch doors, as opposed to
       a 1/3 chance of winning if they choose not to switch; this probability is what this simulator intends to prove
          
  Thanks for playing! Enjoy!
